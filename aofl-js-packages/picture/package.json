  "description": "`<aofl-picture>` serves as a container for zero or more `<aofl-source>` and one `<aofl-img>` elements to provide versions of an image for different display sizes. Display size specific sources are defined using the media attribute of the `aofl-source` element. `<aofl-img>` embeds an image into the document. It behaves similarly to `<img>` with the addition of lazy loading images as they scroll near the visible area of the screen. The current formula is 2x height or width. In addition to this `<aofl-img>` can be combined with `<aofl-picture>` and `<aofl-source>` to provide different images for different display sizes. AoflSource component must be used as a child of aofl-picture and specifies images for different media queries.",
